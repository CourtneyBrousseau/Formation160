# Formation

## About
As a part of Computer Science 160 (User Interface Design and Development), we worked as a team to prototype, design, test, and create an Android application for choreographers called Formation. The app allows choreographers to plan their dances, share blocking formations with dancers, and give feedback based on recordings of practices. Check out [our final video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmrnlg2iy70&feature=youtu.be) to see the app in action.

## Getting Started
To use Formation, clone this project and open it in Android Studio. Create a new Google Firebase project and enable/set up Google Authentication, Cloud Storage, and Realtime Database for the app. Click Run to build the project and try it out on an emulator or physical Android device.
